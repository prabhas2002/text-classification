# text-classification
This is a project which contains different models ,that tries to do text classification . I am using amazon food reviews dataset here , and the labels I am considering for reviews are

1)positive 

2)neutral 

3)negative.

I have implemented several models like rule based classifier, naive bayes classifier and many models yet to come.

The test set accuracy are also mentioned at the the of corresponding notebooks. And note that these are just basic implementations and with many advanced practices , test accuracy can be improved further.
